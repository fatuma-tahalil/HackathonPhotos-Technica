# Hackathon Photos

A memory wall that documents pictures through the Hackathon such as workshops, frustrating codes, progress and team memories. Displaying them on a public album for people to share their memories with other hackers in real time. Encouraging better community engagement as well as allowing for inspiration and help from other hackers.

# How It's Made:
We built the frontend using React and TypeScript to ensure a responsive and modern UI that matched the updates with Hackers memories. The backend is powered by Firebase, which enables real-time photo uploads and storage. We also used Firebase Authentication and Firestore to handle user data and organize photo collections by team or event moments.
