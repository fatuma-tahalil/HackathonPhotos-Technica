# Hackathon Photos

Hackathon photos is a memory wall that documents pictures throughout the hackathon, such as workshops, frustrating codes, progress, and team memories. This web app is made to replace the messy Google Drive with hundreds of photos nobody wants to trudge through. Empowering hackers to share their photos as well as see what other hackers are up to. Allowing for better community engagement and inspiration. We aim to make hackathons all the more memorable.

# How It's Made:
**Tech Used**: HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React, Firebase

We built the frontend using React.jsx to ensure a responsive and modern UI that updates with photo uploads. The backend is powered by Firebase and TypeScript, which manages user authentication, data and photos.

# Getting Started: Development
1. Node.js and npm must be installed. Can be downloaded from [nodejs.org](www.nodejs.org)

# Lessons Learned:
This was our first project using React so alot of lessons were learned. Implementing Google Authentication was very interesting because it required alot of thought in every aspect of the design. It required alot of error-handeling because there was so many aspects it could break. So I was challenged with alot of debugging before it could work. Then the users information had to be uploaded to the database and I faced challenges with the structural design. If taking the information from google was enough or if I had to format it as it's own collection. The most difficult part was then


2. Install the dependencies: 
`npm install`

3. Install firebase dependencies: 
`npm install firebase`

4. Run the application: 
`npm run dev`
