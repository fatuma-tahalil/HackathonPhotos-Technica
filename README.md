# Hackathon Photos

Hackathon photos is a C.R.U.D app that aims to make hackathons more memorable. The app serves as memory wall, documenting pictures throughout the hackathon, such as workshops, frustrating code, progress, and team memories. Empowering hackers to share their photos as well as see what other hackers are up to allowing for inspiration and better community engagement.

# How It's Made:
**Tech Used**: HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React, Firebase
