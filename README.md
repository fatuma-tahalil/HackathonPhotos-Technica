# Hackathon Photos

Hackathon photos is a memory wall that documents pictures throughout the hackathon, such as workshops, frustrating codes, progress, and team memories. This web app is made to replace the messy Google Drive with hundreds of photos nobody wants to trudge through. Empowering hackers to share their photos as well as see what other hackers are up to. Allowing for better community engagement and inspiration. We aim to make hackathons all the more memorable.

# How It's Made:
**Tech Used**: HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React, Firebase

We built the frontend using React.jsx to ensure a responsive and modern UI that updates with photo uploads. The backend is powered by Firebase and TypeScript, which manages user authentication, data and photos.
