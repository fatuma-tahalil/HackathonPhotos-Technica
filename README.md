# Hackathon Photos

Hackathon Photos is a modern C.R.U.D. web app designed to make hackathons more memorable and collaborative. It serves as a digital memory wall, allowing hackers to upload, browse, and share photos from workshops, coding sessions, team moments, and moreâ€”fostering inspiration and community engagement throughout the event.

# Features
- Photo Uploads: Share your hackathon journey by uploading photos in real time.
- Photo Gallery: Browse all event photos, filter by tags (e.g., workshops, group shots, hardware), and get inspired by others.
- Profile Management: Edit your profile, including your display name and profile picture.
- Tagging: Add tags to your photos for easy discovery and organization.
- Authentication: Secure sign-in and sign-out with Google via Firebase.
- Responsive Design: Enjoy a seamless experience on desktop and mobile devices.

# Tech Stack
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, HTML, CSS
- Backend & Auth: Firebase
- Styling: Responsive CSS with modern layouts

We built the frontend using React.jsx to ensure a responsive and modern UI that updates with photo uploads. The backend is powered by Firebase and TypeScript, which manages user authentication, data and photos.
